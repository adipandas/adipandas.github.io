I am a Ph.D. student in [CDS Lab](https://ceas.uc.edu/research/centers-labs/cooperative-distributed-systems-lab.html) at [University of Cincinnati](https://www.uc.edu/) advised by [Dr. Manish Kumar](https://researchdirectory.uc.edu/p/kumarmu) and [Dr. Ali A. Minai](https://eecs.ceas.uc.edu/~aminai/). My research is focused on embodied intelligence in robots.
