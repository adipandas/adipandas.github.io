I designed and taught a class MECH5132/MECH6032 - Robot Control and Design in Spring 2019 at the University of Cincinnati. This class included undergraduate as well as graduate students with a total enrollment of 60. I introduced a new curriculum of project work based on open-source hardware platforms in this course. The students were provided with the kits of robot platforms (including robot arm and/or differential drive robots) and micro-controllers (Arduino Uno). These hardware kits were used by students to implement and test the controllers discussed in class.
