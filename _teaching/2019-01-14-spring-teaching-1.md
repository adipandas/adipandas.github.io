excerpt: "I designed and taught a class on <b>MECH5132/MECH6032 - Robot Control and Design</b> in the Spring 2019 at University of Cincinnati. It was a dual level course including undergraduate as well as graduate students. The class had an enrollment of 60 students. I introduced a new curriculum of project work based on open-source hardware platforms in this course. The students were provided with the kits of robot platforms (including robot arm and/or differential drive robots) and micro-controllers (including Ardunio Uno). These hardware kits were used by students to implement and test the controllers discussed in class. Click [here](https://adipandas.github.io/teaching/2019-spring-teaching-1) to read more."
