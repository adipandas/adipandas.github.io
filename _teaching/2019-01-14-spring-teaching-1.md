This course discussed the design of robot control. I introduced a new approach while offering this course by including open-source hardware platforms. The students were provided with the kits of robot platforms (including robot arm and/or differential drive robots) and micro-controllers (including Ardunio Uno). These hardware kits were used to implement and test the controllers discussed in class.
