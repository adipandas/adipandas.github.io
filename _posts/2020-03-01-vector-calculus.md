This post contains some of the important notes which come in handy while working with vector-calculus.


## Vector Space
A vector space is a collection of objects called vectors, which may be added together and multiplied/scaled by scalars. Scalars are often taken to be real numbers.

$$x=(x_{1}, x_{2}, ..., x_{n}) \tag(eq1)$$

$$x$$ is a vector of $$n$$ dimensions.

## Function
A function is relationship between two sets. It associates an element from frist set to exactly one element of second set.

$$f: X \rightarrow Y \tag{eq2}$$

$$x \mapsto	f(x) \tag{eq3}$$

In the above equation, the set represented by $$X$$ is called **domain** of function $$f$$ and $$Y$$ is called **codomain** of function $$f$$.

This notation in \ref{eq2} can be read as *the function $$f$$ mapping elements of set $$X$$ to elements of set $$Y$$*. Similarly, \ref{eq3} can be read as *$$f$$ maps x to $$f(x)$$*.
