This post contains some of the important notes which come in handy while working with vector-calculus.


## Vector Space
A vector space is a collection of objects called vectors, which may be added together and multiplied/scaled by scalars. Scalars are often taken to be real numbers.

$$\mathbf{x} = (x_{1}, x_{2}, ..., x_{n})$$

$$\mathbf{x}$$ is a vector of $$n$$ dimensions.

## Function
A function is relationship between two sets. It associates an element from frist set to exactly one element of second set.

$$f: \mathit{X} \rightarrow \mathit{Y} \label{eq1}$$

$$\mathbf{x} \mapsto	f(\mathbf{x}) \label{eq2}$$

In equation \eqref{eq1}, the set represented by $$\mathit{X}$$ is called **domain** of function $$f$$ and $$\mathit{Y}$$ is called **codomain** of function $$f$$. This notation can be read as '*the function $$f$$ mapping elements of set $$\mathit{X}$$ to elements of set $$\mathit{Y}$$*'. Similarly, \eqref{eq2} can be read as '*$$f$$ maps $$\mathbf{x}$$ to $$f(\mathbf{x})$$*'.

## Scalar-valued function or Scalar field
The function which maps a vector to a scalar value.

$$f:\Re^n \rightarrow \Re \label{eq3}$$

$$ y = f(\mathbf{x}) \label{scalar-func}$$

Equation \eqref{eq3} maps an $$n$$-dimensional vector to a scalar value. It is a *scalar-valued function*. $$y$$ is a scalar in \eqref{scalar-func} and $$\mathbf{x}$$ is a vector of $$n$$-dimensions.

## Vector-valued function
The function which maps one vector space to another vector space.

$$f: \Re^n \rightarrow \Re^m \label{eq4}$$

$$ \mathbf{y} = f(\mathbf{x}) \label{eq5}$$

Equation \eqref{eq4} maps an $$n$$-dimensional vector to a vector of $$m$$-dimensions. It is a *vector-valued function*. The output value $$\mathbf{y}$$ in \eqref{eq5} is of $$m$$-dimensions and the corresponding input value $$\mathbf{x}$$ is of $$n$$-dimensions.
